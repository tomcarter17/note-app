## Write up

I've tried to focus on quality, with testing and Storybook etc. Eventually, I felt like I spent as much time as I think I could on this, and wasn't able to finish the mentions element of the test. I struggled with finding a way to render the input as HTML rather than plain text, to allow for the mentioning to have different styles. Additionally because of the way the mentioning works, having more than one in a note doesn't really work properly.

Hopefully you'll think what I did finish was to a good standard.

Thanks for reading.
